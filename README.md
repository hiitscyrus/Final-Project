Final Portfolio Project – Cyrus G.

👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Cyrus G., a junior in high school with a passion for learning computer science. Over the past year, I've explored a variety of programming languages and tools, gaining hands-on experience in both frontend development and basic programming logic. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and applying my skills to build creative and interactive projects.

📚 Project Overview
This portfolio project represents the culmination of my work during the school year in computer science. It showcases a collection of projects that I've built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these projects, I learned how to bring my ideas to life on the web, improve my coding structure, and make user-friendly interfaces. From simple games to interactive tools, each project reflects progress in my learning and problem-solving abilities.

🖥️ What's in My Portfolio?
My portfolio website acts as a central hub to display my best web development projects. The site includes:
- An **About Me** section introducing who I am and what I’ve learned.
- Descriptions and screenshots for each featured project.
- Links to live versions of each project so visitors can try them out directly.

🚀 Featured Projects

🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors
A classic game recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly generates its own choice. The winner is determined and displayed instantly.

✍️ Quote & Poem Generator
This creative tool generates random quotes and short poems. It gave me experience with using arrays, JavaScript functions, and DOM manipulation to dynamically update page content.

🥁 Drum Kit Sound Board
A fun and interactive sound board that plays different drum sounds when users click buttons or press keyboard keys. This project introduced me to working with event listeners and audio elements in JavaScript.
