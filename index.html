        <h3>Project 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3>
        <a href="https://codepen.io/cyrusgallo/pen/VYLwqjr" target="_blank">Play Rock, Paper, Scissors!</a>
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        <p>This project was originally done on C++, but it was remade to work with HTML, CSS, and JS. It's very simple, you choose rock, paper, or scissors, and a computer randomly picks one too, and faces off against you. Click to try! </p>

        <p>This project was different from the first. Instead of making a game, we made an easy to use quote and poem generator that gave some very wise words. Click to try!</p>

        <p>This  project was a step in a complete other direction because we implemented the use of audio. We made a drum kit, so users could click buttons on their keyboard, and start listening to a few drums sounds, complete with a tamborine. Click to try!</p>
